## Hey there 👋

I'm **Saurav**, an aspiring **Machine Learning / AI Engineer**.

I’m interested in **Machine Learning**, and I enjoy working on problems where AI can create real-world impact.

Alongside this, I’m actively learning **full-stack web development** to build  
**end-to-end applications** — from model training and experimentation to deployment
and user-facing products.

My goal is to create **real-world AI-powered applications**, not just notebooks.
