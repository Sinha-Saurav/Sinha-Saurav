## Hey there 👋

I'm **Saurav**, an aspiring **Machine Learning / AI Engineer**.

I’m interested in **Computer Vision** and  
**Natural Language Processing**, and I enjoy working on problems where AI can create

**end-to-end applications** — from model training and experimentation to deployment
and user-facing products.

My goal is to create **real-world AI-powered applications**, not just notebooks.
